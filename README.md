# broad-epi-cut-n-run
Porting the 4d nucleosome Cut-and-Run pipeline to WDL


All the scripts that are run come from [4dn github](https://github.com/4dn-dcic/docker-4dn-cut-and-run-pipeline/tree/v1).
The WDL pipeline uses the same v1 docker that already contains all the scripts.

Synchs with Dockstore.
